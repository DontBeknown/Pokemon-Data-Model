# Gotta Predict 'Em All! üêæ

## Overview
This project leverages data modeling techniques to predict the conditions and locations where rare Pok√©mon can be encountered in **Pok√©mon Go**. Inspired by the game's integration of real-world elements, the project uses real-world datasets to provide insights that help players find rare Pok√©mon efficiently.

## Introduction
Pok√©mon Go incorporates augmented reality and real-world mapping to create an engaging experience for players. Rare Pok√©mon appearances depend on various environmental and locational factors like weather, time of day, and proximity to landmarks. This project uses **classification** and **clustering models** to:
- Predict if rare Pok√©mon will appear under specific conditions.
- Group rare Pok√©mon based on their environmental and locational characteristics.

## Data Sources
1. **Pok√©mon Go Spawns (2016 Dataset)**: Includes details such as Pok√©mon ID, location, time, and weather.
2. **Pok√©mon Metadata**: Provides additional Pok√©mon information (e.g., name, type).
3. **Pok√©mon Rarity Levels**: Specifies the rarity classification of Pok√©mon.

Datasets were sourced from:
- [Predict 'Em All Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/semioniy/predictemall)
- [Pok√©mon Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maca11/all-pokemon-dataset)
- [Pok√©mon Rarity Levels](https://web.archive.org/web/20240203201627/https://www.pokego.org/rare-pokemon-list/)

## Data Preparation
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted data types.
- **Feature Engineering**: Added new features like Pok√©mon rarity and normalized environmental variables.
- **Integration**: Merged multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis.

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key insights:
- Rare Pok√©mon are more likely to spawn near **Pok√©Stops** and in urban areas.
- Weather significantly influences Pok√©mon types, with specific types (e.g., Water, Bug) more common in certain conditions.
- Rarity is highest in regions with moderate **population density** and near landmarks.

---

## Modeling Techniques
1. **Classification**: Decision Trees predict whether a Pok√©mon is rare (`True`) or not (`False`) based on environmental and locational factors.
2. **Clustering**: K-means clustering identifies patterns among rare Pok√©mon, grouping them by shared conditions (e.g., proximity to landmarks, weather).

---

## Results
- **Classification**:
  - Accuracy: ~61%
  - Precision (Rare Pok√©mon): ~77%
  - Recall (Rare Pok√©mon): ~63%
- **Clustering**:
  - Identified 9 distinct clusters of rare Pok√©mon based on conditions.
