## Introduction
Pok√©mon Go incorporates augmented reality and real-world mapping to create an engaging experience for players. Rare Pok√©mon appearances depend on various environmental and locational factors like weather, time of day, and proximity to landmarks. This project uses **classification** and **clustering models** to:
- Predict if rare Pok√©mon will appear under specific conditions.
- Group rare Pok√©mon based on their environmental and locational characteristics.
